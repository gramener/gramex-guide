You can use any charting library with Gramex. We recommend the following.

## @gramex charts

@gramex charts are configurable charts built on D3 under the `@gramex/` namespace.

- [@gramex/cartogram](https://gramener.com/gramex-cartogram/)
- [@gramex/documap](https://gramener.com/gramex-documap/)
- [@gramex/insighttree](https://gramener.com/insighttree/)
- [@gramex/network](https://gramener.com/gramex-network/)
- [@gramex/treemap](https://gramener.com/gramex-treemap/)

These are supported by a set of base layers:

- [@gramex/ui](https://gramener.com/gramex-ui/)

... and a set of internal utilities:

- [@gramex/chartbase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gramex/chartbase)
- [@gramex/chartvalidate](https://npmjs.com/package/@gramex/chartvalidate)


## Vega

[Vega](http://vega.github.io/vega/) is a high-level implementation of the grammar
of graphics, allowing the creation of charts with the power of D3 but with
greater ease.

To learn Vega, read the [Vega tutorial](http://gramener.github.io/vegatutorial/).

## D3

[D3](https://d3js.org/) is a powerful low-level JavaScript library that can bind
visual features to data, allowing creation of custom charts.

## Deprecations

- [Gramex Charts](https://gramener.com/gramexcharts/) is a gallery of configurable charts.
- [Chartogram](gallery.html) is a deprecated gallery of Vega charts
- [Gramex Charts](https://learn.gramener.com/gc) (old) is a deprecated library to create charts.
