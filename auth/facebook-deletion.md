title: Facebook Data Deletion
---

The [Gramener Facebook app](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/163328100435225/dashboard/) is
only used to log into the [Gramex Guide](https://gramener.com/gramex/guide/auth/#facebook-auth).

It doesn't save your personal data on our server.

[Facebook policy requires Data Deletion Instructions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/app-dashboard/data-deletion-callback).

To delete your activities for the Gramener App:

1. [Go to your Facebook Account > Setting & Privacy > Settings > Apps and Websites](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications&ref=settings)
2. Against the "Gramener" app, click "Remove"
