Gramex can be used to write standalone applications that send emails. You don't need to run Gramex. Just use it as a library.

Here's a code snippet that you can run to test sending emails (just change the `to=` email ID to your ID).

```python
from gramex.services import SMTPMailer
mailer = SMTPMailer(
    type='gmail',
    email='gramex.guide@gmail.com',   # Replace with your email ID
    password='tlpmupxnhucitpte',      # Replace with your passsword
)
mailer.mail(
    to='person@example.com',
    subject='Subject',
    html='<strong>This is bold text</strong> and <em>this is in italics</em>.',
    body='This plain text is shown if the client cannot render HTML',
    attachments=['1.pdf', '2.txt']
)
```
