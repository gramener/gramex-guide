title: YAML supports multi-line strings
prefix: Tip
...

YAML supports multi-line strings. You can wrap text like this:

```yaml
query: >
  SELECT group, SUM(*) FROM table
  WHERE column > value
  GROUP BY group
  ORDER BY group DESC
```

This is more readable than:

```yaml
query: SELECT group, SUM(*) FROM table WHERE column > value GROUP BY group ORDER BY group DESC
```
