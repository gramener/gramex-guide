title: Testing build errors locally
prefix: Tip
...

To test build errors locally, set it up using:

```bash
pip install -e flake8-gramex
npm install -g eslint@2.6.0 eslint-plugin-template htmllint-cli jscpd
```

Make sure you have `.flake8`, `.eslintrc` and `.htmllintrc` from `yo gramex`. Then run:

```bash
flake8
eslint --ext js,html .
htmllint
```

This will test most build errors. But if you want to test them all, another approach is:

- Push a new branch and test build errors
- Fix them on that branch and keep testing
- When done, merge the new branch into your dev branch using `git merge --squash new-branch`

This is documented on [Wiki](https://learn.gramener.com/wiki/dev.html).
