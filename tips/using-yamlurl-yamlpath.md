title: Using YAMLURL and YAMLPATH
prefix: Tip
...

Suppose you create a gramex.yaml like this:

```yaml
url:
  app-home:
    pattern: / # The home page
    handler: ...
```

This works fine locally. But when you deploy it on a server under `/app`, it won't work. That's
because you've mapped the URL `/`, not `/app/`.

Since you don't know beforehand which directory you'll be deploying the app, it's
best to use pattern: `/$YAMLURL/` instead. `$YAMLURL` the relative URL to the
current `gramex.yaml` location. In your local machine, this becomes `/`. On the
server, this becomes `/app/`.

You also need to use these when specifying [redirection URLs](../config/#redirection).
See this example:

```yaml
url:
  auth/simple:
    pattern: /$YAMLURL/simple
    handler: SimpleAuth
    kwargs:
      credentials: { alpha: alpha }
      redirect: { url: /$YAMLURL/ } # Note the $YAMLURL here
```

Using `/$YAMLURL/` redirects users back to this app's home page, rather than the
global home page.

Tips:

- `/$YAMLURL/` will always have a `/` before and after it.
- `pattern:` must always start with /$YAMLURL/
- `url:` generally starts with `/$YAMLURL/` unless it's for SQLAlchemy URLs

## Using YAMLPATH

`$YAMLPATH` is very similar to `$YAMLURL`. It is the relative path to the current
`gramex.yaml` location.

When using a `FileHandler` like this:

```yaml
url:
  app-home:
    pattern: / # This is hard-coded
    handler: FileHandler
    kwargs:
      path: index.html # This is hard-coded
```

... the locations are specified relative to where Gramex is running. To make it
relative to where the `gramex.yaml` file is, use:

```yaml
url:
  app-home:
    pattern: /$YAMLURL/
    handler: FileHandler
    kwargs:
      path: $YAMLPATH/index.html # Path is relative to this directory
```

Tips:

- `$YAMLPATH/` will never have a `/` before it, but generally have a `/` after it
- `path:` must always start with a $YAMLPATH/
- `url:` for `DataHandler` or `QueryHandler` can use it for `SQLite` or `Blaze` objects.
  For example, `url: sqlite:///$YAMLPATH/sql.db`
