title: Initializing Gramex Projects
prefix: Tip
...

Currently we can initialize projects using `yo gramex`. This needs additional `yeoman` installation and a supporting package.

This feature is now moved into gramex (v1.23) and we can initialize gramex projects using:

```bash
gramex init
```

which will initialize files: index.html, config files (lint files, git files), gramex.yaml, package.json, README.md

## gramex.yaml

`gramex.yaml` will be created with the following line:

```text
# Generated by gramex init on 2017-11-06 by Bhanu K <bhanu.kamapantula@gramener.com>. Please retain this line.
This will help us track the usage of `gramex init`.
```
