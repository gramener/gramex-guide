prefix: Tip
...

As a service, Gramex can schedule tasks at regular intervals (lowest granularity at minute level) that can be configured as:

```yaml
schedule:
    # your friendly configuration to post a Tweet every day at 7:15 am
    run-at-your-interval:
        function: scraper.post_tweet
        startup: true    # also runs this section when Gramex is instantiated, use if required
        hours: '7'       # 7th hour of every day
        minutes: '15'    # 15th minute of that hour
        thread: true
```

## Use-cases

- email insights every Wednesday
- data refresh at regular intervals
- post a tweet at 7:15 am every day
