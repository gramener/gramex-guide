title: Finding slow code

The first step to optimising code is finding slow code.

Gramex 1.x has two functions that help with this.

## timer

The first is [gramex.debug.timer()](../debug/#timer).
It prints the time since its last call. You can introduce it between any two
lines to see how fast it runs. Here is a simple example:

```python
from gramex.debug import timer

def calc():
    timer('start')
    some_code()
    timer('ran some_code()')
```

This prints the following message on the log:

```text
I 05-May 08:16:38 debug:54 0.102s start [module.function:56]
I 05-May 08:16:38 debug:54 0.012s ran some_code() [module.function:58]
```

## lineprofile

The second is [gramex.debug.lineprofile](../debug/#line-profile) - a decorator
that prints the time taken for each line of a function every time it is called.

For example:

```python
import pandas as pd
from gramex.debug import lineprofile

@lineprofile
def calc():
    data = pd.Series([x*x for x in range(1000)])
    diff = data.diff()
    acf = data.autocorr()
    return acf
```

When we run `calc()`, it prints the timing of each line:

```text
Timer unit: 3.52616e-07 s

Total time: 0.00198735 s
File: <ipython-input-8-af6a7bd543d9>
Function: calc at line 4

Line #      Hits         Time  Per Hit   % Time  Line Contents
==============================================================
     4                                           @lineprofile
     5                                           def calc():
     6      1001         3023      3.0     53.6      data = pd.Series([x*x for x in range(1000)])
     7         1          613    613.0     10.9      diff = data.diff()
     8         1         1998   1998.0     35.5      acf = data.autocorr()
     9         1            2      2.0      0.0      return acf
```

## Remember

These functions work even when you're not running a Gramex server. You can use
them in ANY `Python` program or `IPython` script.
