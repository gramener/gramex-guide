title: Reuse YAML configurations via anchors
prefix: Tip
...

`YAML` has a feature called ANCHORS that lets you re-use sections without copy-pasting.

For example, if you use the same `auth:` section or `error:` section in multiple handlers, you don't need to copy-paste the configuration. Just include a reference.

Here's an example

```yaml
url1:
  kwargs: ...
    auth: &GRAMENER_AUTH      # & defines an anchor called GRAMENER_AUTH
      membership:
        hd: [gramener.com]
url2:
  kwargs: ...
    auth: *GRAMENER_AUTH      # * re-uses the GRAMENER_AUTH anchor
```
