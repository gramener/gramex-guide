[TOC]

The `watch:` section in [gramex.yaml](../gramex.yaml.source) triggers events when files are modified. For example:

```yaml
watch:                                  # Define files to watch
    data-files:                         # Create a watched named data-files
        paths:                          # Watch for these files
            - $YAMLPATH/dir/            # - any file under the dir/ subdirectory
            - $YAMLPATH/*.txt           # - any CSV file under this folder
            - $YAMLPATH/data.csv        # - data.csv in this folder
            - data.xslx                 # - data.xlsx from where Gramex was started
        on_modified: module.function    # When file is changed, call module.function(event)
```

Each named watch has the following keys:

- `paths`: a list of files, directories or wildcards to watch for
- `on_modified`: called when the file is modified
- `on_created`: called when the file is created
- `on_deleted`: called when the file is deleted
- `on_moved`: called when the file is moved
- `on_any_event`: called for any change in the file

The event handler functions are called with a single argument `event`. The
`event` is a [watchdog event][event]. Is has the following attributes:

- `event.src_path`: the path that triggered the event
- `event.is_directory`: True if the path is a directory
- `event.event_type`: type of the event.

Here is a sample event handler that prints the event:

```python
def watch_file(event):
    print(event.src_path, event.is_directory, event.event_type)
```


## Watching files

Your functions can watch files efficiently. For example, this code will run
`log()` when `filename.txt` is created, deleted or modified. `log()` will be
called with a [watchdog event][event].


```python
from gramex.services.watcher import watch

def log(event):
    print(event)

watch(name='unique-name', paths=['filename.txt'],
      on_created=log, on_deleted=log, on_modified=log)

# Now, when any changes are made to filename.txt, on_modified is called
# To stop watching, use this:
unwatch(name='unique-name')
```

## inotify limit

On Linux, Gramex creates a new inotify instance for each folder observed. The
default system limits may not be enough for this.

If you see an "inotify watch limit reached" or "inotify instance limit reached"
error, run these commands to increase the limit:

```bash
printf "fs.inotify.max_user_instances=512\n" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
printf "fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288\n" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl --system
```

Some [useful commands for debugging](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13758877/how-do-i-find-out-what-inotify-watches-have-been-registered):

```bash
# Lists inotify usage:
for foo in /proc/*/fd/*; do readlink -f $foo; done | grep inotify | cut -d/ -f3 |xargs -I '{}' -- ps --no-headers -o '%p %U %a' -p '{}' | uniq -c | sort -n

# To get the list of processes consuming inotify resources, run:
for foo in /proc/*/fd/*; do readlink -f $foo; done | grep inotify | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# Check max watches
sysctl fs.inotify

# List file descriptors used by a process
for f in `/bin/ls /proc/<proc-id>/fd/`; do readlink -f "/proc/<proc-id>/fd/$f"; done | sort | uniq -c | sort -k 1nr
```

Alternatively, you can disable the Watch by setting it as `False` in gramex.yaml. This can be useful in containerized apps where you can't modify the host inotify limit.

```yaml
    app:
        watch: False
```
