[TOC]

This tutorial shows how to let users log into your Gramex application
with their Microsoft accounts. Specifically, we will go over how to:

1. set up an app registration on Microsoft Azure that recognizes a Gramex
   application,
2. use the OAuth2 handler to connect a Gramex application to the Azure app.

## Prerequisites

To follow through this tutorial completely, you will need:

1. A Microsoft account
2. Gramex Enterprise

Gramex Enterprise can be installed as follows:

```bash
pip install gramexenterprise
gramex license accept
```

## Set up an App Registration on Azure

Go to [`portal.azure.com`](https://portal.azure.com) and log in through your
Microsoft account.

At the top of the page, type "app registration" in the search bar, and select
the "App Registrations" service which shows up in the search results.

You should now be able to see a page for app registrations. Then, click "New
registration" at the top left of the page.

![New registration](img/new-registration.png){.img-fluid}

Then, you should be able to see the application registration form. Give it an
appropriate name, and leave the "Supported account types" section to the default
selection.

### Specifying the Redirect URI

At the bottom of the app registration form, we will need to specify a redirect
URI. **This must be the fully qualified login URL of your Gramex application**.
For example, if the login URL of a particular endpoint in your Gramex
application is `/$YAMLURL/login/`, and you are running Gramex on `localhost:9988`,
then the redirect URI to be added here is `http://localhost:9988/login/`.

### Getting the Client ID and Client Secret

After you register the application, you should be redirected to the applications
registrations details page. Before proceeding, create a file named
`.secrets.yaml` in your project directory, if it doesn't already exist. (To learn
more about how Gramex secrets work, see [this](../../deploy/#gramex-yaml-secrets).)
Then, on the Azure portal, under the "Essentials" section of the app
registration, click on "Add a certificate or secret".

![Create secret](img/create-secret.png){.img-fluid}

At the bottom of this page, you should see a section for client secrets. Click
'New client secret'.

![New client secret](img/new-client-secret.png){.img-fluid}

Create the secret, and copy it.

![Copy secret](img/copy-secret.png){.img-fluid}

**Note**: We need to copy the "Value" of the secret, not its ID.

Add the copied secret to `.secrets.yaml` under the name `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
Your `.secrets.yaml` should have the following line:

```yaml
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET: "<secret copied from the portal>"
```

Next, go to the "Essentials" section, copy the "Application
(Client) ID", and add it to `.secrets.yaml` under the name `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`.

![Copy client ID](img/copy-client-id.png){.img-fluid}

### Getting the Authorization and Access Token URLs

There are two more values we need to retrieve from the app registration, namely
the authorization URL and the access token URL. Click the "Endpoints" tab at the
top of the app registration page.

![Endpoints](img/endpoints.png){.img-fluid}

This should reveal a list of endpoints, which look like this:

![Endpoints view](img/endpoints-view.png){.img-fluid}

Copy the first two URLs in the list (the authorization endpoint and the token
endpoint) and put them in `.secrets.yaml` under the names `AZURE_AUTHORIZE_URL`
and `AZURE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL` respectively.

Finally, make sure that your `.secrets.yaml` contains these four variables:

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_AUTHORIZE_URL`
- `AZURE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL`

We are now ready to set up the OAuth2 handler

## Setup the Gramex OAuth2 Handler

In your `gramex.yaml`, use the following spec:

```yaml
url:
  azure_oauth-login:
    pattern: /$YAMLURL/login/ # Login URL - This must map to the redirect URL provided to Azure
    handler: OAuth2
    kwargs:
      client_id: $AZURE_CLIENT_ID
      client_secret: $AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
      authorize:
        url: $AZURE_AUTHORIZE_URL
        scope:
          - https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read
      access_token:
        url: $AZURE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL
        body:
          grant_type: "authorization_code"
      user_info:
        url: "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me"
        headers:
          Authorization: "Bearer {access_token}"
```

Your users can now log in with their Microsoft accounts.
