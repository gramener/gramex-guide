## FormHandler Edits Modify

[FormHandler Edit](../../formhandler/#formhandler-edits) methods now supports `modify:` method. For PUT, POST, etc, methods now you can run an action AFTER the edit action.

Below configuration has two `modify:` -- which are called after edit operation.

```yaml
formhandler-edits-multidata-modify:
  pattern: /$YAMLURL/edits-multidata-modify
  handler: FormHandler
  kwargs:
    csv:
      url: $YAMLPATH/sales-edits.csv
      encoding: utf-8
      id: [city, product]
      modify: emailer.send
    sql:
      url: mysql+pymysql://root@$MYSQL_SERVER/DB?charset=utf8
      table: sales
      id: [city, product]
    modify: emailer.sendall
```

`modify:` can be any expression/function that uses `data` -- count of records edited and `handler` -- `handler.args` contains data submitted by the user.

## Upgrade

Note: `gramex >= 1.41` onwards requires `Anaconda >= 5.2.0`

To upgrade Gramex, run:

```bash
pip install --verbose gramex==1.43
```

To upgrade apps dependencies, run:

```bash
gramex setup --all
```

This downloads Chromium and other front-end dependencies. That may take time.
