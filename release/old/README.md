title: Gramex Old Release Notes
prefix: Old Releases
...

## v1.29.0 (2018-02-15)

[SAMLAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#SAML-auth) is now a
part of Gramex. Most enterprise Single-Sign-On (SSO) implementations are
now SAML-enabled, including Microsoft ActiveDirectory. Gramex can
integrate with all of these apps now. (@vinay.ranjan)

[ProxyHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/proxyhandler/) is a new
handler that lets you:

1. Access data from server-side APIs directly from the browser (e.g.
   Gmail API, Google Translate, SalesForce API, etc)
2. Expose non-Gramex applications within a Gramex app -- using Gramex
   Auth.

[FormHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/) has several
enhancements:

- [FormHandler
  tables](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/#formhandler-tables)
  are a client-side component that quickly render FormHandler data as
  tables
- Using [FormHandler
  parameters](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/#formhandler-parameters)
  you can allow users to choose the file, database or table. This is
  using URL query parameters like `?table=...` as well as path
  arguments like `/database/table`.
- You can specify HTTP headers for all formats using the `headers:`
  kwarg.
- [FormHandler
  headers](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/#custom-http-headers)
  now has an example of CORS - accessing FormHandler data from other
  servers via HTTP (@pratap.vardhan)
- Examples of matrix and grid charts for [FormHandler
  charts](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/#formhandler-charts)
  are available (@pratap.vardhan)

[Alerts command
line](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/alert/#alert-command-line) usage
gives you access to [Smart
alerts](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/alert/) give you access to
alert emails from command line. You can use this as a local mail merge
app.

[FunctionHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/functionhandler/)
supports the `method:` kwarg. You can decide which HTTP methods to
support - including `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.

A few common queries are documented:

- [session data](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#session-data)
  features a guide on how to pick a session store --specifically, how
  to handle sessions with multiple Gramex instances (@pratam.vardhan)
- [How XSRF
  works](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/filehandler/#how-xsrf-works)
  explains the underlying workings of XSRF

Stats:

- Code base: 21,636 lines (gramex: 13,772 - a reduction, tests: 7,864)
- Test coverage: 79%

## v1.28.0 (2018-01-31)

[FormHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/) has two
major upgrades. [FormHandler
charts](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/#formhandler-charts)
use the [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) library to generate
static charts on the server as SVG or PNG (PDF too.) Setting `?meta=y`
returns metadata as HTTP headers.

The [UI component
library](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/uicomponents/) now uses
[Bootstrap 4](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2018/01/18/bootstrap-4/)
stable version. New components are:

- [numeral.js](http://numeraljs.com/) library
- `.modal-left` and `.modal-right` overlays
- [g1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/g1) is upgraded to v0.4 which
  features an improved `$().formhandler()` component. This lets you
  render FormHandler data as an interactive Excel-like table
  component. (@tejesh.papineni)

[Smart alerts](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/alert/) can now:

- fetch images and attachments from URLs. This lets you attach
  dashboards as PDFs or images in conjunction with
  [CaptureHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/capturehandler/)
- specify an option to run the alert only once, based on any
  condition. This lets you stop repeated emails of the same kind
- define data in-place in the YAML, rather than using a file or a
  database
- log all alerts sent in a log file
- use the first `email:` service defined by default (you don't need to
  specify a `service:` every time)

[PPTXHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/pptxhandler/) exposes URL
query parameters in the configuration. This lets you generate
presentations whose content can be updated by the URL. For example, you
can create a certificate template, and set `?name=` to update the
recipient's name. (@ranjan.balappa).

[FunctionHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/functionhandler/) can
now return NumPy objects as well -- not just Python objects.
(@tejesh.papineni)

Thanks to the recent Docuthon, documentation has improved. Key changes:

- The [deploy](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/deploy) section
  features a checklist (@vinay.ranjan) and how to set up Gramex as a
  service
- The [UI component
  library](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/uicomponents/) documents
  how to create equal height layouts (@mohmad.jakeer)
- Steps to create pre-defined Gramex
  [apps](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/apps/) are documented

Note: the `condition()` transform is deprecated. No known repository
uses it.

Stats:

- Code base: 21,478 lines (gramex: 13,822, tests: 7,656)
- Test coverage: 79% (reduced due to new features with less test
  coverage)

## v1.27.0 (2018-01-20)

[g1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/g1) is upgraded to v0.3 which
features a `$().formhandler()` component. This renders FormHandlers as
Excel-like tables (sortable, filterable).

[FormHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/) supports a
`?meta=y` query parameter that returns metadata about the query. This
includes the number of rows, offset, limit, sort options, columns
excluded, etc.

The [UI component
library](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/uicomponents/) now uses
[Bootstrap 4 Beta
3](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2017/12/28/bootstrap-4-beta-3/). New
components are:

- `.arrow-tail` which adds a tail to arrows
- `.border-radius-sm`, `.border-radius-lg`, etc which create rounded
  corners of different sizes
- `.btn-xs` for extra-small buttons
- `.modal-xl` for extra-large modals
- `.cursor-pointer` as a utility class for `cursor: pointer`
- Improvements to `.switch` and `.upload`

The [UI component
library](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/uicomponents/) page itself is
more usable:

- Theme fonts now include a few (carefully picked) Google Fonts
- The sidebar is sticky.
- The "Toggle source" button at the top lets you view / hide source
  code
- The list of libraries are better documented

[CaptureHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/capturehandler/)
supports repeated `?dpi=` arguments for PPTX that allow creating
multiple slides with differently sized images (@pragnya.reddy).
`?title_size=` sets the title font size for pptx.

Using auth handlers for [AJAX
login](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#ajax-login) is now well
documented.

A new [session
data](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#session-data) store type
called `type: sqlite` is available. This is a bit slower, but allows
multiple Gramex instances to share session data.

[Smart Alerts](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/alert/) templates can
now access the Gramex config. This lets you re-use templates across
different alerts, changing static content in the YAML configuration
(@mukul.taneja).

Gramex supports a [docker
install](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/install/#docker-install)
option. The documentation also features common [Windows
administration](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/deploy/#windows-administration)
options used when deploying Gramex.

Stats:

- Code base: 21,062 lines (gramex: 13,496, tests: 7,566)
- Test coverage: 81%

## v1.26.0 (2017-12-31)

This release features an upgrade to the [UI component
library](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/uicomponents/):

- [g1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/g1) is the new Gramex interaction
  library. It is bundled with Gramex and currently features URL
  manipulation, templates and a few utilities.
- [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/),
  [topojson](https://github.com/topojson/topojson),
  [shepherd](http://github.hubspot.com/shepherd/docs/welcome/) and
  [select2](https://select2.org/) are built into Gramex.
- [Ripples](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/uicomponents/#ripples)
  are available as a CSS utility class
- [Background](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/uicomponents/#background)
  and
  [Gradient](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/uicomponents/#gradient)
  utilities are available
- The Bootstrap theme at `/ui/bootstraptheme.css` is minified by
  default

[CaptureHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/capturehandler/) for
Chrome supports a `window.renderComplete` option. Set
`?delay=renderComplete`. This waits until `window.renderComplete` is
true and then captures the page.

[DBAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#database-auth) can use a
CSV file as its database.

[PPTXHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/pptxhandler/) handles
edge cases better:

- Custom text is allowed in heatgrid by @abhilash.maddireddy
- BulletChart handles NaNs / identical values - and other bugfixes by
  @pratap.vardhan

This release also adds better debugging features:

- `gramex --settings.debug` sets the console log level to DEBUG. This
  makes it easier to start Gramex in debug mode.
- [FormHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/) and
  `gramex.debug.cache` print the executed query in debug mode
- The console logs now print the handler name that rendered the URL

Gramex now uses [bandit](https://github.com/openstack/bandit/) to test
for internal vulnerabilities like SQL injection.

Stats:

- Code base: 20,825 lines (gramex: 13,480, tests: 7,345)
- Test coverage: 80%

## v1.25.0 (2017-12-15)

This release features [Smart
Alerts](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/alert/) - a rule-based email
alert service. This can be used to:

- Send customized reports on a schedule
- Send alerts only if specific events happen
- Mail different groups different reports based on their roles, only
  if required

The [UI component
library](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/uicomponents/) has been
extended with several custom components:

- Hover, focus and active styles
- Text size classes
- Underline classes
- Absolute positioning classes
- Overlay classes
- Divider component
- Tail (call-out) component
- Switches (styled checkboxes)

Also, D3 4.0 is now part of the UI components library.

A basic [Log viewer](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/logviewer/) app is
part of Gramex. It shows the history of all pages accessed on Gramex.

Gramex console logs are more informative. Each request prints the name
of the handler used to process it. This tells you whether the correct
handler processed the URL or not. Also, when starting up, the list of
all handler classes and priorities and shown.

To enable debug mode from the command prompt, run
`gramex --settings.debug`.

## v1.24.0 (2017-11-30)

**Note**: Before installing this release, you install
[node](https://nodejs.org/) 8.x or above, and also run
`npm install -g yarn`. Also run `pip install` with a `--verbose` option.
Gramex installs several UI libraries and the installation is slow. Yarn
speeds up the installation. `--verbose` lets you see progress.

This release adds a [UI component
library](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/uicomponents/) that includes a
series of standard front-end libraries and a Gramex-customized version
of Bootstrap 4. By @bhanu.kamapantula

All auth handlers support a [inactive
expiry](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#inactive-expiry) feature
that closes a session if no requests were made for a certain period.

[DBAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#database-auth) supports
a [Sign up](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#sign-up) feature that
lets users create their own accounts. By @nikhil.kabbin

[DBAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#database-auth) used to
ignore the `redirect:` key when directly POSTing via AJAX. So the
response would always redirect to `/`. If `/` is not a valid URL, it
would return an error. This is now fixed --
[DBAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#database-auth) always
uses `redirect:`.

[PPTXHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/pptxhandler/) pptgen
supports text styles, heatgrid order, pie/donut colors, and a number of
other features. By @sanjay.yadav

[FormHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/) and
`gramex.data.filter` accept a `queryfile:` parameter that lets you
specify queries in a separate SQL file. This makes indentation and
syntax highlighting easier, making it easier to debug queries.

`gramex init` and all Gramex installations use Yarn in offline mode if
possible - prefering Yarn over npm. This is to optimize installations.

A few developer enhancements and bugfixes:

- `gramex.cache.open` can open XML, RSS and Atom files using lxml. It
  returns an etree object.
- All handlers support a `handler.get_arg(key)` method that is exactly
  like Tornado's `handler.get_argument(key)`, but supports Unicode
- `gramex.cache.Subprocess` waits for return code and then exits

Stats:

- Code base: 20,514 lines (gramex: 13,305, tests: 7,209)
- Test coverage: 81%

## v1.23.1 (2017-11-13)

This is an interim release with minor features and major bugfixes.

- [PPTXHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/pptxhandler/) is
  formally released as part of Gramex, with extensive examples and
  documentation.
- [CaptureHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/capturehandler/)
  supports a PPTX download option that downloads image screenshots and
  pastes them into slides.
- `gramex init` is the new way of initializing Gramex repos. It just
  copies the minimal files required to get started, but will soon
  include boilerplates.
- [FileHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/filehandler/) headers
  can be different for different file patterns. So within the same
  directory, you can serve different files with different content
  types and expiry using the same FileHandler. [Issue
  176](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/176)
- All auth handlers lets you [change
  inputs](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#change-inputs) using
  a `prepare:` function. You can decrypt browser-encrypted passwords,
  prefix a `DOMAIN\` to the username, or restrict access by IP. [Issue
  180](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/180)
- [Print
  statements](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/debug/#print-statements)
  can be replaced by `gramex.debug.print` - is a smarter replacement
  for `print`. It also prints the file and line where you inserted the
  print statement, making it easier to trace flow.
- [Tracing](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/debug/#tracing) line by
  line execution is with the `gramex.debug.trace()` decorator makes
  it very easy to see which lines in a function were executed.

The bugfixes are:

- Multiple Gramex instances running on the same system no longer
  over-write sessions. (This led to logouts.) [Issue
  147](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/147)
- `gramex.cache.open` used to cache based on the file and its type,
  not arguments. So `gramex.cache.open('data.csv', encoding='cp1252')`
  and `gramex.cache.open('data.csv', encoding='utf-8')` would return
  the same cached result. This is fixed. [Issue
  171](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/171)
- [FormHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/) and
  [DBAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#database-auth)
  support tables with schemas (i.e. table names with dots in them,
  like `schema.table`.) [Issue
  185](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/185) and [Issue
  186](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/186)
- A bug in [watch](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/watch/) led to
  file permission errors on Mac systems. This is resolved. [Issue
  183](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/183)

Stats:

- Code base: 19,026 lines (gramex: 12,890, tests: 6,136)
- Test coverage: 65% (pptgen coverage is a gap)

## v1.23.0 (2017-10-31)

This release adds Gramex as a [Windows
service](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/deploy/#windows-service),
making it easier for Windows administrators to auto-start and manage
Gramex. Run `gramex service install` from the app directory to create a
service.

[FormHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/) has
improved -- you won't need FunctionHandler even to edit data.

- [FormHandler
  edits](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/#formhandler-edits)
  data in databases and files. This makes it possible to create
  editable tables or settings pages.
- [FormHandler
  filters](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/#formhandler-filters)
  support NULL and NOT NULL operators
- [FormHandler
  query](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/#formhandler-query)
  supports URL query parameters as values, just like filters
- [FormHandler formats](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/#formhandler-formats) supports two new formats:
  - `table` format that is an Excel-like viewer for any data.
    (Future releases will allow embedding this component into
    templates.)
  - `pptx` format to download as a PPTX
- [FormHandler
  downloads](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/#formhandler-downloads)
  let you change the downloaded filename via `?download=filename`
- [FormHandler
  queryfunction](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/#formhandler-queryfunction)
  lets you generate your own custom query using Python. Typically used
  for dynamically generated queries

[CaptureHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/capturehandler/)
supports Chrome as a backend engine. This allows screenshots that are
far more accurate than PhantomJS.

Running `gramex setup <directory>` lets you [set up
apps](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/apps/#setting-up-apps) by running
`npm`, `bower`, `pip install` and any other relevant installations in
the target directory. This can also set up pre-installed apps like
`formhandler` or `capture`.

Logging is standardized. All logs are logged to `$GRAMEXDATA/logs`.
There are 3 types of logs, out-of-box:

1. [Gramex logging](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/config/#logging)
   saves all Gramex log messages on the console to `logs/gramex.log`
2. [Request
   logging](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/config/#request-logging)
   saves all HTTP requests to `logs/requests.csv`
3. [User
   logging](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/config/#user-logging)
   saves all login and logout actions to `logs/user.csv`

All logs are auto-rotated weekly by default, and the location and fields
can be configured. All logging is now through the standard Python
logging mechanism.

Auth handlers can now implement a "Remember me" option when users log
in, and set up different [session
expiry](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#session-expiry) values
based on the user's choice.

[LDAPAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#ldap) fetches [LDAP
attributes](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#ldap-attributes) with
direct LDAP login. (Earlier, this was possible only through bind LDAP
login.)

[DBAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#database-auth) has an
`email_as` key that sends forgot password emails from a specific email
ID.

Gramex configurations support
[conditions](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/config/#conditions).
Sections will be included only in specific environments.

[YAML imports](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/config/#yaml-imports)
allow overriding the \$YAMLURL value. This lets you mount applications
from any place into any URL. Imports also support lists.

There are several API improvements. The most important are:

- `gramex.cache.open` guesses file type from its extension. So
  `gramex.cache.open('data.csv')` now works -- you don't need to
  specify `csv` as the second parameter.
- `gramex.data.filter` updates the `meta` object to add 2 attribute:
  `count` which reports the number of records matched / updated, and
  `excluded` which reports excluded columns
- `gramex.services.SMTPMailer` supports open email servers without
  passwords.

For security purposes, Gramex deletes all old session keys without an
expiry value. (These originate from Gramex versions prior to Gramex
1.20.)

There are several bug fixes, documentation enhancements and test cases
added.

- Code base: 15,924 lines (gramex: 10,028, tests: 5,896)
- Test coverage: 79%

## v1.22.0 (2017-09-28)

This release adds Windows
[IntegratedAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#integrated-auth).
This allows Windows domain users to log into Gramex automatically
without entering and ID or password.

[FormHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/) has
improved - you won't need FunctionHandler to process data.

- [FormHandler
  defaults](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/#formhandler-defaults)
  set up default URL query parameters that the user can override
- [FormHandler
  prepare](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/#formhandler-prepare)
  lets you add / modify / delete the URL query parameters dynamically
- [FormHandler
  query](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/#formhandler-query)
  can be dynamically filled with URL query parameters
- [FormHandler
  query](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/#formhandler-query)
  has a `table:` key. If you specify a simple query here, the results
  will be cached based on that query
- [FormHandler
  modify](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/#formhandler-modify)
  lets you change the returned dataset before rendering

[CaptureHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/capturehandler/)
supports a `?debug=1` URL query parameter that logs HTTP responses and
PhantomJS messages to the console. `?debug=2` also logs HTTP requests
made. The Guide also features a live example. CaptureHandler's
`selector` parameter is improved and captures portions of a page better.

The default error pages shown for HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error), 404
(Not Found) and 403 (Forbidden) are a little more informattive and
better designed.

All auth handlers support a custom [session
expiry](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#session-expiry) duration.
You can increase / decrease the cookie's expiry duration.

This release also features an undocumented
[PPTXHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/pptxhandler/) that
generates PowerPoint presentations. But the API will change. This
handler not meant for general use yet. A future release will define and
document the specs.

There are some enhancements to the API:

- `gramex.cache.Subprocess` returns the stdout and stderr values if
  no streams are specified
- `gramex.transforms.twitterstream.TwitterStream` supports a `flush=`
  option that saves the stream data periodically
- `gramex.cache.query` does not cache queries by default. It caches
  only if a `state=` is specified. (This may change.)
- `gramex.data.filter` ignores empty query parameters, which is the
  expected behaviour

There are some changes to Gramex behaviour that may impact your
application:

- [UploadHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/uploadhandler/)
  backup file naming has changed from `name.ext.<time>` to
  `name.<time>.ext`
- The [deploy yaml](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/deploy/#security)
  configuration hides the `Server:` HTTP header for security
- [Google Auth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#google-auth)
  stores the email ID of the user as the user ID, not the Google
  provided ID
- All handlers have a `handler.kwargs` attribute that has the
  `kwargs:` configuration passed to the handler

Stats:

- Code base: 14,765 lines (gramex: 9,278, tests: 5,487)
- Test coverage: 79%

## v1.21.0 (2017-08-29)

This is a major release with new functionality. There are two new
handlers.

- [CaptureHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/capturehandler/)
  takes image screenshots and PDF downloads from Gramex. It uses
  PhantomJS behind the scenes. Future releases will allow Chrome
  headless.
- [FormHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/) is a
  simplified replacement for
  [DataHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/datahandler/) and
  [QueryHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/queryhandler/). If
  you want to expose data from any file or database after transforming
  it, use
  [FormHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/).

[UploadHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/uploadhandler/) is also
improved. Specifically:

- You can [overwrite
  uploads](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/uploadhandler/#overwriting-uploads)
  in the way you want.
- You can customize the [uploaded
  filename](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/uploadhandler/#saving-uploads).

All requests are now logged under `$GRAMEXDATA/logs/requests.csv`,
independent of the console display. This will be used in the next
release to show app usage.

When writing code, there are a few new features:

- [YAML
  imports](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/config/#yaml-imports) are
  simplified. You can now write `import: filename.yaml` instead of
  `import: {key: filename.yaml}`.
- It's easier to [parse URL
  arguments](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/functionhandler/#parse-url-arguments)
  inside
  [FunctionHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/functionhandler/).
  All handlers have a `handler.args` dict that has the URL arguments.
  `?x=1` sets `handlers.args` to `{'x': ["1"]}`. Unlike Tornado's
  `.get_arguments()`, this supports Unicode keys.
- You can also [parse URL
  arguments](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/functionhandler/#parse-url-arguments)
  using `handler.argparse()`, which lets you convert arguments to the
  right type, restrict values and so on.
- You can convert GET requests to POST, PUT or DELETE via [method
  overrides](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/jsonhandler/#method-override).
  This works on ANY handler. Add a `X-HTTP-Method-Override: POST`
  header or `?x-http-method-override=POST` to the URL to convert GET
  to POST.
- `gramex.data.filter` lets you filter DataFrames using URL
  arguments. This is the powerful filtering mechanism behind
  [FormHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/formhandler/).
- `gramex.data.download` helps create downloadable CSV, XLSX, JSON or
  HTML files from one or more DataFrames.
- When running a subprocess, use `gramex.cache.Subprocess`. This is
  an async method and does not block other requests.
- `gramex.conf.variables.GRAMEXPATH` can be used to identify the PATH
  where Gramex source libraries are located.

Documentation is also improved to cover:

- Sending [email
  attachments](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/email/#email-attachments)
  and [command line
  emails](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/email/#command-line-emails)
- Accessing [predefined
  variables](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/config/#predefined-variables)
  from a FunctionHandler
- Deploying an [nginx reverse
  proxy](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/deploy/#nginx-reverse-proxy)
  server

There are a number of bugfixes on this release. The most important are:

- This release works on Python 3 as well. (The previous release 1.20
  did not.)
- Session keys can contain Unicode characters. (Earlier, this raised
  an error.)
- `gramex.cache.open` returns separate results for different
  transforms
- If the `log:` configuration has an error, Gramex does not stop
  working

There is one deprecation this release. `handler.kwargs` is now
`handler.conf.kwargs`. (This is a largely unused feature of Gramex.)
UPDATE: this was re-introduced in 1.22.

## v1.20.0 (2017-07-31)

This is a major release with some critical enhancements and fixes.

(NOTE: This release supports Python 2, not Python 3 due to a temporary
bug.)

Firstly, caching is improved.

- `gramex.cache.open` accepts a `transform=` parameters that lets you
  post-process the returned result.
  `gramex.cache.open('data.xlsx', 'xlsx', transform=process_data)`
  ensures that `process_data(data)` is called only if the `data.xlsx`
  has changed.
- `gramex.cache.open` supports a `rel=True` parameter. If specified,
  it loads the file from the path relative to the calling file. So if
  `module.py` calls `gramex.cache.open('data.xlsx', 'xlsx', rel=True)`
  loads `data.xlsx` in the same directory as `module.py`, not relative
  to gramex.
- `gramex.cache.open` supports a `'config'` mode that loads YAML
  files just like Gramex does -- i.e. with environment variables
  support, and returning the values as AttrDict instead of dict.

Gramex supports inline images in HTML
[email](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/email/). This is useful when
sending visualizations as images in emails.

There is better support for programmatic authentication.

- The `X-Gramex-Key` header lets you [override
  users](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#encrypted-user) by
  specifying an encrypted JSON object for the user. (Documentation
  pending)
- [OTP](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#otp) (one-time
  passwords) are now available.
- The `password:` function in
  [DBAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#database-auth) can
  now accept a `handler` object apart from the `content` (which is the
  password)

There are a few security enhancements.

- [DBAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#database-auth) and
  [SimpleAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#simple-auth)
  delay the response on repeated login failures. You can specify the
  `delay:` in `gramex.yaml`.
- Every time the user logs in, the session ID changes. This avoids
  [session
  fixation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_fixation).
- The session ID cookie uses
  [HttpOnly](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HttpOnly) cookies. If the
  request is made on HTTPS, it also uses
  [Secure](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SecureFlag) cookies.

The performance of sessions has been improved as well.

- Sessions stores were constantly polled to see if they had changed.
  This drains the CPU. Now, changes are tracked. Sessions are saved
  only if there are changes.
- Expired sessions are cleared on the server. So the session store
  will no longer bloat indefinitely.

Command line usage of Gramex is improved.

- `gramex --help` shows Gramex command line usage. `gramex -V` shows
  the version.
- On startup, Gramex informs users of keyboard shortcuts available
  (`Ctrl+B` for opening the browser and `Ctrl+D` for debugging.)
- Gramex warns you when `url:` sections have duplicate keys, and
  override one another. This helps when running on shared instances
  like `uat.gramener.com`.
- When loading a module (e.g. from a
  [FunctionHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/functionhandler/)),
  it would not get reloaded if it had an error. This is fixed.

There are a couple of obscure fixes to
[DataHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/datahandler/).

- [DataHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/datahandler/) no
  longer raises an error if you have empty values in queries, like
  `?city=`.
- [DataHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/datahandler/) has an
  undocumented `posttransform` method. It now works for PUT method as
  well as POST, but continues to be undocumented.

Finally, there are a few documentation updates.

- A detailed [line
  profile](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/debug/#line-profile)
  example is available.
- All [exercises](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/exercises/) have
  been consolidated into a single page.

## v1.19.0 (2017-07-09)

This is a minor enhancement release with

- There was a bug where sessions were not being flushed, forcing users
  to log in when Gramex is restarted. This if fixed.
  [\#84](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/84)
- Instead of using `args:` and `kwargs:` in gramex.yaml, you can now
  use `function: method(arg, arg, key=val, ...)`.
- The user interface of the default login templates is improved. Here
  is the new [DBAuth login
  template](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/dbsimple).
- [Reloading](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/debug/#reloading) of
  configurations, modules and files is seamless. You don't need to
  restart Gramex when your Python code or templates change.
- [Query
  caching](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/cache/#query-caching) via
  `gramex.cache.query` caches SQL query results
- [DataHandler
  templates](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/datahandler/#datahandler-templates)
  and [QueryHandler
  templates](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/queryhandler/#queryhandler-templates)
  let you customize the output of these handlers arbitrarily
- `gramex.cache.open` supports new formats: `md` for Markdown, `xls`
  or `xlsx` for Excel, and `template` for Tornado templates.
- `gramex.cache.opener` makes it easier to create callbacks for
  `gramex.cache.open`.
- `gramex.config.CustomEncoder` is a custom JSON encoder that encodes
  objects that contain DataFrames. This makes it easy to JSON dump
  objects that contain DataFrames.
- The [deploy yaml](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/deploy/#security)
  configuration now protects against XSS attacks as well.
- If Gramex is re-installed in a different location, the guide does
  not load. The error message now asks the user to uninstall the
  guide. [\#76](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/76)

## v1.18.0 (2017-06-29)

This is a minor enhancement release with several critical bugfixes.

- This version requires Anaconda 4.4.0. It also requires recent ldap3
  and psycopg2 versions. Please upgrade by running
  `conda update conda` and then `conda update anaconda`.
- [Installation](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/install/) is
  simpler. It's a one-line install using `pip` (no `conda`).
- Gramex runs on Python 3.6 (as well as Python 3.5 and 2.7)
- [Module
  caching](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/cache/#module-caching) is
  now available via `gramex.cache.reload_module()`. You can refresh
  Python files without restarting Gramex.
- [Data caching](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/cache/#data-caching)
  is more robust. It checks file sizes in addition to the timestamp.
  `gramex.cache.open()` now supports loading Tornado templates, apart
  from various data / text files. It also supports loading the same
  file via multiple callbacks (e.g. loading a CSV file as `csv` and
  `text`.)
- [Login
  templates](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#login-templates)
  are now reloaded every time the template changes.
- Access logs enabled by default. These are weekly CSV files stored at:
  - Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%Gramex Datalogsaccess.csv
  - Linux: \~/.config/gramexdata/logs/access.csv
  - OS X: \~/Library/Application Support/Gramex Data/logs/access.csv
- [YAML
  imports](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/config/#yaml-imports)
  allow namespaces. You mostly won't need this. But if you're running
  multiple apps, this avoid conflict between URLs defined in each.
- [QueryHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/queryhandler/) has
  some bugfixes. If you have multiple queries, and only some of them
  use URL query parameters are arguments, it no longer fails. It also
  does not crash if the query returns no results.
- [FileHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/filehandler/) was
  checking URLs against `allow:` and `ignore:`. It should have been
  checking file paths. As a result, the [deploy
  yaml](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/deploy/#security) was
  disabling sub-directories. Also, the [deploy
  yaml](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/deploy/#security) file was
  not getting installed. Both are fixed.
- Several sections have improved documentation. [Offline
  install](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/install/#offline-install).
  [HTML email](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/email/#html-email).
  [Reusing
  configurations](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/config/#reusing-configurations).
  [Static file
  caching](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/cache/#cache-static-files).

## v1.17.1 (2017-04-23)

This is a maintenance release with a few minor enhancements:

- [TwitterRESTHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/twitterresthandler/)
  and
  [FacebookGraphHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/facebookgraphhandler/)
  use GET request by default. This used to be the POST request. This
  is a **breaking change**.
- Access token on
  [TwitterRESTHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/twitterresthandler/)
  and
  [FacebookGraphHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/facebookgraphhandler/)
  are persisted

A series of important bugfixes are addressed:

- Tornado 4.5 routing module uses a `tornado.routing.Router` Class
  instead of handlers. This requires an alternate way of clearing
  existing handlers.
- scandir requires a C-compiler to install. Change docs and setup
  script to avoid upgrading libraries (particularly scandir) via
  `--upgrade` when running pip install.
- HTTP 304 requests (i.e. cached requests) preserve and re-send the
  same headers as the original response

## v1.17 (2017-01-29)

This version has a breaking change. The default login URL is `/login/`
instead of `/login`. This makes it easier to create custom login pages
using FileHandler (e.g. `/login/index.html`). If your application
breaks, in your gramex.yaml `app:` section, add `login_url: /login` to
revert the change.

- [WebSocketHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/websockethandler/)
  lets you create websocket servers on Gramex.
- [DataHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/datahandler/) and
  [QueryHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/queryhandler/)
  support the `?filename=` parameter to specify a download filename
- Several enhancements to authentication including:
  - Each URL can have its own [login
    URL](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#login-urls) via
    a `login_url:` key.
  - [Roles](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#roles)
    membership can be checked through multiple AND / OR
    combinations
  - [Google
    Auth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#google-auth)
    now allows accessing logged-in users' Google data
  - Auth handlers' [auth
    redirection](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/config/#redirection)
    supports `?next=` by default
  - [Login
    templates](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#login-templates)
    are documented
  - [SimpleAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#simple-auth)
    now lets you add other attributes (e.g. roles) to the user
    object
- [Data caching](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/cache/#data-caching)
  is easier with the `gramex.cache.open()` method
- A major bug related to
  [watch](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/watch/) is fixed.
- Some bugs related to JSONStore (used for session storage) are fixed

## v1.16 (2016-10-16)

- Add a [deploy yaml](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/deploy/#security)
  configuration that makes your deployment automatically more secure
- [QueryHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/queryhandler/)
  supports INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements as well via POST requests.
- The [email](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/email/) service accepts
  [attachments from strings](https://learn.gramener.com/gramex/gramex.services.html#gramex.services.emailer.message)
- [LDAPAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#ldap) can [bind
  as an admin](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#bind-ldap-login)
  and log in as any user
- Configuration in the `handlers:` section percolates to other
  handlers
- [UploadHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/uploadhandler/)
  transforms accept handler as a second cargument in addition to
  metadata
- Fixed bugs to improve security, reduce the CPU usage, better JSON
  handling for binary data, HDF5store corruption, multiple email
  recipients, caching 304 responses,

## v1.15 (2016-08-21)

- [DataHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/datahandler/)
  supports a `?q=` parameter that searches all text columns
- [QueryHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/queryhandler/)
  supports multiple SQL queries in a single request
- [DataHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/datahandler/) and
  [QueryHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/queryhandler/)
  support a `?format=xlsx` to download as Excel. In QueryHandler,
  multiple SQL queries translate to multiple sheets
- [TwitterStream](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/twitterresthandler/#twitter-streaming)
  scheduler can now write to SQLAlchemy databases, as well as run a
  custom function when it receives a tweet
- The [watch](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/watch/) service
  supports wildcards and directories in paths. You can watch for
  changes to a pattern of files or any files under a directory
- `gramex.transforms.flattener` transform that flattens JSON
  hierarchies based on a custom field mapping
- `gramex.init()` supports a `force_reload=True` that reloads services.
  To support this, `gramex.transforms.build_transform` is no longer
  cached.

## v1.14 (2016-08-11)

- [TwitterStream](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/twitterresthandler/#twitter-streaming)
  is a scheduler function that provides Twitter Streaming API support.
- [FacebookGraphHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/facebookgraphhandler/)
  lets you use the Facebook data via the Graph API.
- [QueryHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/queryhandler/) lets
  you execute arbitrary SQL queries with parameters.
- [DataHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/datahandler/) accepts
  a `?count=1` parameter and returns an `X-Count` HTTP header that has
  the number of rows in the query (ignoring limit/offset).
- All handlers support an `xsrf_cookies: false` to disable XSRF
  cookies for a specific handler.
- Add a `template: "*.html"` to
  [FileHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/filehandler/) kwargs
  to render all HTML files as Tornado templates. `template: true`
  renders all files as templates.

## v1.13 (2016-08-01)

- All handlers support custom [error
  handlers](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/config/#error-handlers).
  You can show custom 404, 500 pages.
- [SimpleAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#simple-auth) is
  an extremely simple login handler you can use for testing
- [ProcessHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/processhandler/)
  supports the `redirect:` config (used by many handlers) to redirect
  the user after the process is executed.
- [DataHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/datahandler/)
  supports a `thread: false`. This switches to a synchronous version
  that is (currently) less buggy.
- Variables can be assigned different values in different environments
  via a simple [conditional
  variables](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/config/#conditional-variables)
  syntax.

## v1.12 (2016-07-21)

- [DBAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#database-auth)
  features a forgot password feature.
- [FileHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/filehandler/)
  supports `POST` and other HTTP methods via the `methods:`
  configuration. `POST` is now available by default.
- The `cache:` key supports user attributes. You can cache responses
  based on the user.
- Gramex loads a bit faster by importing slow modules (e.g. Pandas)
  only if required.

## v1.11 (2016-07-15)

- A data browser app is ready. Run `gramex install databrowser` and
  then `gramex run databrowser` to run it at any time.
- [UploadHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/uploadhandler/)
  allows users to upload and manage files.
- [TwitterRESTHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/twitterresthandler/)
  allows end-users to log in and use their own access. tokens. It can
  also limit the API to just a single method.
- By default,
  [TwitterAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#twitter-auth)
  redirects users back to the same URL that initiated the login
  request.
- The [email](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/email/) service allows
  developers to send emails via SMTP services (e.g. GMail, Yahoo,
  etc.)
- `gramex setup` can be run in any directory to run the
  [apps](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/apps/) setup. It runs
  `setup.sh`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `npm install`, `bower install`,
  etc.
- If an app has `requirements.txt`, the
  [apps](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/apps/) setup also runs
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- The `template:` config is now optional for
  [LDAPAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#ldap) and
  [DBAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#database-auth). A
  built-in (but minimal) login screen is available by default.
- The `redirect:` config (used by many handlers) supports relative
  URLs.
- Gramex's log no longer shows the user name on the console by
  default. This was making the request logs quite long.

## v1.10 (2016-07-01)

- [DataHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/datahandler/) can now
  write back into relational databases. This lets you create
  form-based applications easily.
- [DataHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/datahandler/)
  displays only the first 100 rows by default. (It used to display the
  entire table, which was slow.)
- [DataHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/datahandler/) caches
  metadata (i.e. table column names) until restarted or until
  `gramex.yaml` changes. This speeds up DataHandler considerably.
- [TwitterRESTHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/twitterresthandler/)
  lets you access the Twitter API easily without blocking the server.
- You can add `set_xsrf: true` to the `kwargs:` of any URL handler.
  This sets the XSRF cookie when the URL is loaded.
- If `gramex.yaml` has duplicate keys, Gramex raises an error, warning
  you up-front.
- The `handlers.BaseHandler.log.format` config lets you define the
  application log format. The default value is
  `'%(status)d %(method)s %(uri)s (%(ip)s) %(duration).1fms %(user)s'`.
  It can be overridden to use any other format.

## v1.0.9 (2016-06-15)

- Gramex supports
  [sessions](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#sessions). Whether
  a user is logged in or not, `handler.session` is a persistent
  dictionary that you can use to store information against that user
  session.
- Users can log in via LDAP and ActiveDirectory using the
  [LDAPAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#ldap) handler.
- Users can log in via any database table containing user IDs and
  passwords using the
  [DBAuth](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#database-auth)
  handler.
- All auth handlers support a consistent [auth
  redirection](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/config/#redirection),
  allowing apps to redirect them to the right page after login.
- Users can log out via the
  [LogoutHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#log-out).
- User login is logged via [auth
  logging](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#logging) to a CSV
  file.
- When a user logs in, you can perform custom actions (such as logging
  them out of other sessions)
- All URLs support
  [authorization](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/auth/#authorization)
  via an auth: section. You can check if the user is member of a
  group, or any arbitrary condition defined as a Python function.
- [FileHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/filehandler/) allows
  you to [ignore
  files](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/filehandler/#ignore-files)
  matching a pattern.
- Gramex automatically logs startup and shutdown events using the
  `eventlog:` service. It checks the [Gramex update
  page](https://gramener.com/gramex-update/) daily for updates, and
  uploads the event log.
- A new `none` pre-defined
  [log](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/config/#logging) handler is
  available. It ignores log events.
- `gramex update <app>` re-installs the app.
- Press `Ctrl+B` on the console to start the browser (in case you
  forgot `--browser`.)

## v1.0.8 (2016-06-01)

- Gramex supports installation of
  [apps](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/apps/). You can run
  `gramex install <app> <url>` to install an app from a folder, git
  repo, URL, etc. Apps can define setup scripts (such as bower
  install, etc.) which will be executed after the app is installed.
  `gramex uninstall <app>` uninstalls the app
- Apps are run via `gramex run <app>`. Local apps are run via
  `gramex run <app> --target=DIR`. Any command line options (e.g.
  `--listen.port=8888` or `--browser=true`) will be stored and re-used
  with the next `gramex run <app>`.
- The new [debug](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/debug/) module has
  two timer methods `gramex.debug.timer` and `gramex.debug.Timer`, and
  a line profiler decorator `gramex.debug.lineprofile`. These will
  help profile your functions.
- Press `Ctrl+D` on the Gramex console to start the interactive
  IPython debugger. This freezes Gramex and lets you run commands
  inside Gramex.
- Run `gramex --debug.exception=true` to start the debugger when any
  handler encounters an exception.
- [FileHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/filehandler/)
  supports pattern mapping. This makes it easier to flexibly map URL
  patterns to filenames.
- `gramex.yaml` can use two new variables: `$GRAMEXPATH` -- the path
  where Gramex is installed, and `$GRAMEXDATA` -- the path where
  Gramex apps are installed by default.
- You can override values after an `import:` in `gramex.yaml`.
- Console logs are now in colour on all platforms.
- `Ctrl+C` will shutdown Gramex gracefully. You no longer need
  `Ctrl+Break`.

There are two changes that may disrupt your code:

- If you have invalid functions in `gramex.yaml`, Gramex will no
  longer run. Remove or fix them.
- Files served by Gramex's `default` FileHandler are cached on the
  browser for 1 minute. Press `Ctrl+F5` to reload. Override the
  `default` FileHandler to change this behaviour.

## v1.0.7 (2016-05-15)

- We have a new
  [JSONHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/jsonhandler/) that
  implements a JSON store. It is similar to the [Firebase
  API](https://www.firebase.com/docs/rest/api/). It lets you save,
  modify and retrieve any JSON structure. It is intended for small
  data (typically under 1MB) like settings.
- All handlers support
  [caching](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/cache/). Any request can
  be cached for a fixed duration. The cache can be in-memory or
  disk-based (shareable across instances) and both caches have a size
  limit imposed. The cache key can also be configured.
- The [scheduler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/scheduler/)
  supports threads. Using the `thread: true` configuration runs the
  scheduled task in a separate thread.
- The [log](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/config/#logging) section now supports 2 additional handlers (apart from `console`).
  - `access-log` writes information logs to a CSV file `access.csv`
  - `warn-log` writes warnings to a CSV file `warn.csv`
- A new `threadpool:` service has been added. This is used internally
  by services to run code in a separate thread. You can use
  `threapool.workers` to specify the number of concurrent threads that
  are allowed.
- Gramex handlers are now passed a `name` and `conf` parameter which
  identifies the name and configuration used to create them.
- The `AuthHandler` falls back to weaker HTTPS certificate
  verification --specifically if Google authentication fails due to
  older HTTPS certificates on systems.

## v1.0.6 (2016-05-01)

- In the `app:` section, the `browser:` key accepts either `true` or
  any URL. If a URL is provided, it opens the browser at that URL on
  startup. If `true`, it opens the browser to the home page of the
  application.
- Gramex config variables (in the `variables:` section) may contain
  other variables. For example, you can define a variable `HOME` in a
  `config.yaml`. This can be re-used in the variables section of an
  imported YAML file as `$HOME`.
- Config variables can be computed using the `function:` parameter.
  For example, `VAR: {function: module.fn}` will run `module.fn()` and
  assign `$VAR` the returned value.
- [FileHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/filehandler/)
  supports an `index_template:` key that allows customized directory
  listings. It can be any custom-styled HTML file that uses `$path`
  and `$body` respectively to represent the full path to the directory
  and the contents of the directory.
- [DataHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/datahandler/) is now
  asynchronous. Requests won't be blocked while queries run.
- [ProcessHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/processhandler/)
  accepts `stdout` and `stderr` parameters. These can be `false` to
  ignore the output, or set to any file name (to save the output /
  errors in that file.) The default for `stdout` and `stderr` is
  `pipe`, which sends the output to the browser.
- Gramex defers loading of services to ensure a faster initial loading
  time.
- Gramex guide is a part of Gramex. There's no need to install it
  separately.

## v1.0.5 (2016-04-15)

- Gramex config YAML files support custom variables. You can define a
  variable in the `variables:` section and use it as `$VARIABLE`
  anywhere in the YAML file, its imports or in subsequent layers. They
  default to environment variables.
- You can use the pre-defined variables `$YAMLFILE` (current YAML file
  name), `$YAMLPATH` (current YAML directory), and `$YAMLURL`
  (relative URL path from where Gramex is running to current YAML
  directory) in your template.
- Command line arguments override the `app:` configuration. So running
  `gramex --listen.port=8999` from the command line will run Gramex on
  port 8999, irrespective of the port configuration.
- Add a `browser: true` to automatically start the browser on Gramex
  launch. You can also use `gramex --browser=true`.
- [ProcessHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/processhandler/)
  implemented. It runs any program as a sub-process and streams the
  output to the request.
- [FunctionHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/functionhandler/)
  accepts co-routines for asynchronous processing. Functions can also
  `yield` strings that will be immediately written and flushed,
  providing a streaming interface.
- [FileHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/filehandler/) accepts
  multiple `path` as an array. The output of these files are
  concatenated after transformated.
- In the [FileHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/filehandler/)
  config, you can use `pattern: /abc` instead of `pattern: /(abc)` if
  you are mapping a single URL to a single path.
- [FileHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/filehandler/)
  supports `function: template` in the transforms section. This treats
  the file as a tornado template and renders the output.
- [FileHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/filehandler/)
  directory listing looks prettier now.
- [DataHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/datahandler/)
  supports `like` and `notlike` operations.
- The [watch](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/watch/) section of
  `gramex.yaml` allows you to trigger events when files are changed.

## v1.0.4 (2016-03-30)

- [FunctionHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/functionhandler/)
  supports co-routines and works asynchronously
- [FileHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/filehandler/) is the
  new name for `DirectoryHandler` (both will work)
- Implement authentication via Google, Twitter and Facebook OAuth
- Simpler installation steps

## v1.0.3 (2016-01-18)

- Implement
  [DataHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/datahandler/) that
  displays data from databases (via
  [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and
  [Blaze](http://blaze.pydata.org/))
- `DirectoryHandler`:
  - lets gramex.yaml specify input file encoding (defaults to
    UTF-8)
  - takes both content as well as the handler as input
- gramex.yaml URL priority can be specified explicitly using
  `priority:`

## v1.0.2 (2015-10-11)

- Implement
  [FunctionHandler](https://learn.gramener.com/guide/functionhandler/)
  that renders any function
- `DirectoryHandler` transforms files (e.g. converting Markdown or
  YAML to HTML)
- `gramex.transforms.badgerfish` transform converts YAML to HTML
- When a configuration file is changed, it is reloaded immediately
- Document Gramex at <https://learn.gramener.com/gramex/>
- Add test cases for handlers

## v1.0.1 (2015-09-09)

- Is a directory-browsing webserver
  (`gramex.handlers.DirectoryHandler`)
- Works with Python 3 in addition to Python 2
- Add test cases with full coverage for `gramex.config` and
  `gramex.confutil`
- Logs display friendly dates, and absolute paths instead of relative
  paths

## v1.0.0 (2015-09-08)

- First release of core server
