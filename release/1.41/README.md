## Python console

[Admin module](../../admin/admin/) now comes with web-based python console. This embedded Python console executes within the context of the Gramex instance.

[Read the documentation](../../admin/) on how to set it up admin page.

## Error Reporting

We now report error more meaningful information on incorrect `gramex.yaml` `url` config.
If a `url:` configuration has an error (e.g. the `kwargs` are wrongly specified)

```yaml
url:
  invalid:
    pattern: /invalid
    handler: DBAuth # do not add any kwargs
```

We now report error message like

## AJAX Uploads

Guide now has example for UploadHandler [AJAX usage via DropZone](../../uploadhandler/#ajax-uploads)

## 40X reporting

We now show user info in `403` error.

Added a separate `401` error page

## Favicon

Most applications fail to add a favicon.ico. This leads to several HTTP 404
errors, wasted bandwidth and wasted computing

By default, Gramex now provide a default `favicon.ico` from the Gramex/ directory.

No change is required in the code.

## Gramex Update

Gramex update app now [shows usage stats](https://gramener.com/gramex-update/).
Currently, restricted to @gramener folks.

### Logviewer

We've now added `cutoff_buffer` parameter to add `minutes` to first and last request in a session,
while calculating [logviewer](../../logviewer/) session time.

[Link Checker](../../linkcheck/) tests if all links on the Gramex Guide are working.

Gramex [installation](../../install/) instructions are now simplified a bit.

## Upgrade

Note: `gramex >= 1.41` requires `Anaconda >= 5.2.0`

To upgrade Gramex, run:

```bash
pip install --verbose gramex==1.41
```

To upgrade apps dependencies, run:

```bash
gramex setup --all
```

This downloads Chromium and other front-end dependencies. That may take time.
