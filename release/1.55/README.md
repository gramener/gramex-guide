## FormHandler summarizes data

To get totals for any dataset, add `?by=` to the URL. For example,
[this link summarizes the flags data](../../formhandler/flags?_format=html&_by=)

![FormHandler summary](formhandler-summary.png)

Instead of sum, you can use average, count, min, or max for each columns. For example,
[?\_by=&\_c=c1|avg&\_c=c2|count](../../formhandler/flags?_format=html&_by=&_c=c1|avg&_c=c2|count)
averages `c1` and counts `c2`.

![FormHandler summary aggregations](formhandler-summary-aggs.png)

You can also apply aggregations for subsets of data. For example,
[?\_by=&continent=Europe](../../formhandler/flags?_format=html&_by=&continent=Europe)
shows the totals only for `continent=Europe`.

## UI component upgrades

g1 is upgraded from 0.16.1 to 0.17.0, which introduces
[$().template()](../../g1/template) subtemplates, and fixes a minor bug in
[$.formhandler](../../g1/formhandler) time zone handling.

Bootstrap-select has been updated to 0.13.10. This fixes bug [#138](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/138).

Other UI components have also been updated to the latest patch versions.

## Other enhancements

- Log viewer now supports scrolling when the number of categories is long. It also supports custom data transforms [#160](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/160)
- The Docker instance is based on Miniconda instead of the full Anaconda. This shrinks the image size (but it's still at ~2.5GB). This fixes [#81](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/81)
- Documentation on [custom fonts](../../uicomponents/#custom-fonts) added [#124](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/124)

## Bug fixes

- FormHandler date support for SQL filtering. Fixes [#146](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/145) ([#149](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/pull/149))
- Preview for [alert-capture](../../admin/admin/alert) works. Fixes Fixes [#84](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/84)
- Install SpaCy dependencies for CI [#159](https://github.com/gramener/gramex/issues/159)
- [Admin scheduler](../../admin/admin/schedule) displays all schedules, including those that didn't start on startup. The scheduler is also re-entrant -- so we can run multiple times in parallel. (This may not be a )
